## General Information
This app called pyPongGame helps me understand how the pygame module works.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Technologies Used
- Python v3.10
- pygame v2.4.0

<!--
## Features
List the ready features here:
- Awesome feature 1
- Awesome feature 2
- Awesome feature 3


## Screenshots

<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->


## Setup
Python 3.10 and the pygame module are required to run this project. 
- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- https://www.pygame.org/news.html
<!--
Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?
Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project. -->
How to install them can be found on each of its websites.
To run the project, go to the folder where its copy is saved and open it in the command line or terminal.
Then enter the command: `$ python3 pyPongGame.py `


## Usage
To play, just move the mouse in the game window. The program captures the movement of the mouse pointer over the game window and moves the player's blue paddle. The second red paddle is controlled by the program. The movement of the red paddle has been chosen so that the computer loses the ball from time to time. (This is less frustrating for the player.)
It is also possible to control the player's paddle using the arrow keys - left, right. In this case, it requires the player to concentrate more on the movement of the ball.
